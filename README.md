## Description
It's really annoying to see very long link while in conversation on discord.
This bot shortens such links and replaces the original message with shortened link.
It even adds some additional information including ratings and prices.

## Notice
The bot needs `MANAGE_MESSAGES` and `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS` permissions to work properly.

## How to run the bot
1. Install [deno](https://deno.land).


2. Set your discord bot token to `TOKEN` environment.
3. Run `deno -A mod.ts`.
